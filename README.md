# rfgannet
Regional classification of India has been proposed using k-means clustering where the value of k has been chosen based on elbow method. In elbow method, the value of k is chosen so as to minimize the within cluster sum of square error i.e., WCSS. Apart from this, RfGAN is designed using LSTM and CNN. The accuracy of RfGAN is validated in form of various parameters like precision, recall, F1 score, specificity, MCC, etc.
